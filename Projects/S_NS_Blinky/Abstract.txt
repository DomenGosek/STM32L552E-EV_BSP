The 'S_NS_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32L552ZE' microcontroller using ST 'STM32L552E-EV' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    = MSI     =   4 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           110 MHz

 - The example demonstrates the interworking between secure and non-secure mode
   on an ST 'STM32L552ZE' Cortex-M33 microcontroller.

 - Secure Application:
     Setup core.
     Initialize LEDs.
     Configure SystemCoreClock.
     LD4:  function call from Secure to NonSecure code via registered function pointer using Secure SysTick.

 - Non-Secure Application:
     LD5:  function call from NonSecure to Secure Code via exported Secure functions  using NonSecure SysTick.
     LD6:  function call from NonSecure to Secure code via exported Secure functions  using while loop.

  - Target options:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Debug adapter:             ST-Link

 - Hardware Mapping:
            Virtual I/O      Board
   LED      vioLED0          LD4
   LED      vioLED1          LD5
   LED      vioLED2          LD6

--------------------------------------------

User Option Bytes configuration:
STM32L5xx User Option Bytes should be set according the application configuration.
The proper User Option Bytes setup is in line with the project linker/scatter file.
    TZEN=1
    DBANK=1
    SECWM1_STRT=0x0  SECWM1_PEND=0x7F   meaning all 128 pages of Bank1 set as secure
    SECWM2_STRT=0x1  SECWM1_PEND=0x0    meaning no page of Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure
